# Bitcoin miner simulator
This program implements a simulation of a miner in C, there are two approaches currently to the program, both should work in essentially the same manner, and most of the changes come to the data structure's definition, and / or how they handle events.
## Input
The program reads from stdin, so you can either run it and give it all necessary input (i.e. ./miner < test.00.in), or you can manually provide set data through the console, either way, you can see examples of what should happen for any given set of inputs in the tests folder by comparing your results to the expected ones.
